## Required Tools and Hardware
- A #6-32 tap.
- 7/64 and 3/32 hex wrench.
- 4 x #4-40 x 3/8 stainless socket head cap screws.
- 8 x #6-32 x 1/2 stainless socket head cap screws.
- 4 x #6-32 x 1 stainless socket head cap screws.

## Tapping
First you will need to tap the holes on the RTS-BACK. The four holes that attach the RTS-COVER to the RTS-BACK, and the 8 holes that attach the RTS-FRAME to the RTS Back, will need to be tapped.

## Assembly
Once you are finished printing the parts, you are now ready to assemble.

### Step 1
Assemble the Raspberry Pi touchscreen.

1. Insert the large ribbon from the screen into the connector on the bottom of the display driver board and compress the retainer clip.
2. Insert the small ribbon from the screen into the connector on the top of the display driver board and compress the retainer clip.
3. Attach the display driver board to the screen using the supplied risers.

### Step 2
Assemble the frame.

1. Simply insert the screen into the RTS-FRAME through the back.
2. Insert the supplied display ribbon into the connector on the side of the display driver board and secure with the clip.
3. Insert the supplied red wire on pin 1 of the header on the display driver board.
4. Insert the supplied black wire on pin 4 of the header on the display driver board.

### Step 3
Attach the frame to the back.

1. Thread the display ribbon, red wire and black wire through the opening in the RTS-BACK.
2. Place the frame assembly onto the RTS-BACK.
3. Secure the frame using the 8 #6-32 x 1/2 stainless socket head cap screws.

### Step 4
Attach the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ to the screen.

1. First attach the display ribbon into the display connector on the Raspberry Pi and secure with the clip.
2. Insert the red wire on pin 1 of the header on the Raspberry Pi.
3. Insert the black wire on pin 3 of the header on the Raspberry Pi.
4. Place the Raspberry Pi on the raisers from step 1, while doing this allign the tabs on the USB ports to the USB openings on the RTS-BACK.
5. Secure the Raspberry Pi to the screen using the supplied screws with the touchscreen.

### Step 5
Attach the RTS-COVER.

1. Place the RTS-COVER onto the RTS-BACK.
2. Secure the cover with 4 #6-32 x 1 stainless socket head cap screws.

### Step 6
Attach the legs.

1. Place the corrisponding leg onto the RTS-BACK. There is a right and left leg. The wider part goes in twards the center.
2. Ensure that that the USP mini power plug faces down twards the base of the legs.
3. Secure using 4 #4-40 x 3/8 stainless socket head cap screws.

  > The tap on the screen is a M3 metric thread. The #4-40 screws will work but might alter the threads. #4-40 screws were chosen because they are easier to find. Also 3/8 inch screws are the max length you should use here. If the screws are longer they can damage the back of the screen.
