> This is remixed from 0110-M-P's design on Thingverse, however it is not compatible with it. This has a different bolt pattern.

### Compatibility
- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
- Raspberry Pi 2 Model B
- Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+

### Configurations
This includes multiple mount configurations;
- 75 mm VESA mounts
- 100 mm VESA mounts
- 8020 mounts
- No mounts

Also included are multiple top configurations;
- Standard
- Slotted for display and camera ribbons
- 25 mm and 30 mm fan cutouts
- Clean version (great for modding and remixing)

Special configuration for the official Raspberry Pi touchscreen. Wihch also includes multiple configurations;
- Standard
- Slotted for a camera ribbon
- 25 mm and 30 mm fan cutouts
- Clean version (great for modding and remixing)

### Features
There also is a retainer bracket that can hold the board without using screws inside the case. This bracket does cover the ribbon slots, so it is best used with the default or blank tops. This is not needed fpr the touchscreen because the motherboard attaches to the back of the screen.

### Assembly
To assemble the case you will need;
- 4 x #4-40 x 1/4 socket head cap screws (If you don't use the retainer bracket)
  Used to attach the Raspberry Pi to the base.

- 4 x #6-32 x 3/4 socket head cap screws
  Used to attach the top to the base.

  > The screws will self tap, but it you have a #6-32 tap it is recommended to tab the mount holes on the base.

More detailed instructions can be found here. [Assembly Instructions](https://github.com/mkellsy/rpi-case-model/blob/master/RPI-ASSEMBLY.md).

To assemble the touchscreen case you will need;
- 4 x #4-40 x 3/8 socket head cap screws
  Used to attach the legs and the back to the screen. 

  > The threads on the screen are M3, however #4-40 will work but might alter the threads. I used #4-40 screws because they are easier to find.

- 4 x #6-32 x 1/2 socket head cap screws
  Used to attach the frame to the back.

- 4 x #4-32 x 1 socket head cap screws
  Used to attach the cover to the back.

### 1/21/2019 Update.
- Added slotted, 25 mm fan and 30 mm fan tops without the honeycomb.

### 1/20/2019 Update.
- Since #4-40 screws are hard to find, I changed the bolt pattern to accommodate #6-32 screws.
- Added support backing for the frame screws.
- Added material behind the frame mounts.
- Added 4 frame mount points to better compress the screen.
- Changed leg geometry to clear the new frame mounts.

### 1/19/2019 Update.
- Changed the honeycomb pattern, it is much cleaner now.
- Added a retainer that holds the board inside the case without screws.
- Lengthened the touchscreen legs to accommodate larger USB power cables.

### 1/18/2019 Update.
- Rotated the STL files to lay flat on the print bed. (SolidWorks has a different orientation)
- Added a 8020 mount base.
- Added a slotted top for display and camera ribbons.
- Added a 25 mm and a 30 mm fan top.
- Added a blank top.
- Added a slotted back cover for a camera ribbon.
- Added a 25 mm and a 30 mm fan back cover.
- Added a blank back cover.

### 1/17/2019 Update.
- Added a no mount base.
- Added a 100 mm VESA mount base.
- Combined the left and right legs into one STL file.
- Increased the thickness of the legs to better fit #4-40 x 3/8 screws without contacting the back of the screen.
