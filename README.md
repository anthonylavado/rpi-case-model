3D source files for the honeycomb Raspberry Pi case and matching touchscreen case.

This includes multiple mount configurations;
- 75 mm VESA mounts
- 100 mm VESA mounts
- 8020 mounts
- No mounts

Also included are multiple top configurations;
- Standard
- Slotted for display and camera ribbons
- 25 mm and 30 mm fan cutouts
- Clean version (great for modding and remixing)

Special version for the official Raspberry Pi touchscreen. Wihch also includes multiple configurations;
- Standard
- Slotted for a camera ribbon
- 25 mm and 30 mm fan cutouts
- Clean version (great for modding and remixing)

There also is a retainer bracket that can hold the board without using screws inside the case. This bracket does cover the ribbon slots, so it is best used with the default or blank tops. This is not needed fpr the touchscreen because the motherboard attaches to the back of the screen.

### 1/19/2019 Update.
- Changed the honeycomb pattern, it is much cleaner now.
- Added a retainer that holds the board inside the case without screws.
- Lengthened the touchscreen legs to accommodate larger USB power cables.

### 1/18/2019 Update.
- Rotated the STL files to lay flat on the print bed. (SolidWorks has a different orientation)
- Added a 8020 mount base.
- Added a slotted top for display and camera ribbons.
- Added a 25 mm and a 30 mm fan top.
- Added a blank top.
- Added a slotted back cover for a camera ribbon.

- Added a blank back cover.

### 1/17/2019 Update.
- Added a no mount base.
- Added a 100 mm VESA mount base.
- Combined the left and right legs into one STL file.
- Increased the thickness of the legs to better fit #4-40 x 3/8 screws without contacting the back of the screen.

### To assemble the case you will need;
- 4 x #4-40 x 1/4 socket head cap screws
- 4 x #4-40 x 1/2 socket head cap screws

### To assemble the touchscreen case you will need;
- 8 x #4-40 x 3/8 socket head cap screws
- 4 x #4-40 x 3/4 socket head cap screws

> The threads on the screen are M3, however #4-40 will work but might alter the threads. I used #4-40 screws because they are easier to find.

> This is remixed from 0110-M-P's design on Thingverse, however it is not compatible with it. This has a different bolt pattern.
